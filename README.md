# Supply and Redeem ETH on Compound

### Description:
A simple test to supply and redeem ETH using the Compound protocol. It shows that a user gets cEth tokens in exchange for supplying ETH. It also shows that interest is accrued after a user supplies ETH and some time passes. Finally, at the end, a user can redeem the cEth tokens to get back their ETH supplied plus interest.

Go to [supply-test.js file](https://github.com/lawofambak/Compound-ETH-Supply-Test/blob/master/test/supply-test.js) to simulate supplying and redeeming ETH on Compound using Hardhat's mainnet forking feature.

Run `npx hardhat test`
